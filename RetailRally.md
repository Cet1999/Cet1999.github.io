### About this Project

Retail Rally is a split-screen multiplayer party game. And players can use their cellphones to connect to the game, to get their assigned shopping list and a mini map of products.

My main responsibility for this project is **to design the gameplay around the cellphone and implement them using C# (.NET)**. Our target platform is Windows - Android / iOS.
