The game uses environmental storytelling to evoke emotional impact on players. 

As the lead designer, I designed all the gameplay and the narrative structure of the game. I also collaborated with the artist team to design and constructed the whole level of the game.

As the lead programmer, I developed major functionalities of the game with Unreal Blueprint and C++, I also constructed an in-engine pipeline for the artist team so that they can add custom interactions to their model by just tagging their model, like "inspect", "Pickip", etc.
