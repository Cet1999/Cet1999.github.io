### About this Project

The game uses environmental storytelling to evoke emotional impact on players. 

As the lead designer, I **designed all the gameplay and the narrative structure of the game**. I also **collaborated with the artist team to design and constructed the level of the game**.

As the lead programmer, I **developed major functionalities of the game with Unreal Blueprint and C++**, I also **constructed an in-engine pipeline for the artist team** so that they can add custom interactions to their model by just tagging their model, like "inspect", "Pickup", etc.

As the animator I **did all the cut sceens and animations using Unreal Level Sequencer**
