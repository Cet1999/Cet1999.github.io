### About this Project

Voyage is a virtual travel experience. It simulates the Earth with Google Map geo-data and presents it to players based on their chosen coordinates. It is also a shared environment. Players can meet other travelers in this game, share their journey and make their own marks in the world. The project is created to give players positive energy and a sense of hope during this global pandemic.
