## Need for Greed

 - Genre: Board Game

 - Team Size: 4

 - Role: Designer

 In this game players face unemployment and resultant homelessness as they attempt to manage their time and resources to survive and find a new job. Theyâ€™ll have to wander around the city to beg, steal, and avoid the police to gather enough resources to accumulate a stable income for survival in the big city. But they had better do it fast, or else someone else could get the job they need!

 As the designer I led the team through the whole design process: Brainstorming, Ideation, Prototyping, Playtesting and several Iterations.
