### About this Project

This is the game I made during [Global Game Jam 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdcq7CbPsc) under 48 hours. The theme was "Repair". During my brain storming process I decided to make the "game" itself being the object of repair (This was kinda inspired by "Baba is You" which is one of my favorite indie games of 2019). I constructed an impossible level for each puzzle, players need to modify the level layout in order to pass.

I finally managed to complete 4 levels using 48 hours. The game received a lot of possitive feedbacks as some play testers saying it was "unique and elegant". But there are definitely a lot to improve. Hopefully I will have time to further polish it in the future.
